README before installing Matlab
===============================

There is a new version of Matlab (R2021b).

There are 2 installation methods. Both have pros and cons:

1) Matlab-install-from-Science.txt :
	+ no registration needed
	+ easy workflow: download, unzip, install
	- newest macOS versions will quarantine the download. There is a workaround, but
	  non-technical users might find this problematic
	- big download, even if you only want a few toolboxes.

2) Matlab-install-from-Mathworks.txt
	+ easy to install, also for older versions
	+ small download if you only want a few toolboxes
	- signing in  (creating an account) at The Mathworks necessary with RU or Radboudumc mail address.
	- more complex workflow: create account, download installer, install with created account

You can also use Matlab Mobile (http://nl.mathworks.com/mobile/), a
lightweight Matlab desktop for iPhone/iPad and Android, that connects to
a Matlab session running on MathWorks Cloud or on your computer. From
smartphone or tablet, typical Matlab tasks like evaluating commands,
running scripts, creating and manipulating plots and figures,
and viewing results can be performed. Custom keyboards on iOS and
Android help to easily enter Matlab syntax. To use it, install the
app from the App Store or Play Store and create a Mathworks account at
https://nl.mathworks.com/mwaccount/register?uri=%2Fmwaccount%2F with
an email address ending in: @science.ru.nl, @student.science.ru.nl,
@donders.ru.nl, @pwo.ru.nl, @let.ru.nl, @fm.ru.nl, @ai.ru.nl,
@socsci.ru.nl, @ru.nl, @student.ru.nl or @radboudumc.nl .
