For Windows/Linux/macOS, you can download the installer directly
from www.mathworks.com if you sign in (create an account) in the upper
right corner with your RU or Radboudumc mail address.
Add our Academic License with license code 38957 to your account.
Then hit "Download" and pick the version you want for the
Operating System you want. This will download the installer (ca. 200 MB).
You can then log in to the installer and select to install the Academic
license 38957.  The installer will ask you to browse the attached license
file Matlablicense.txt. So you should have saved that in a place that
you can find.

    - If you install all toolboxes, the installation might need ca. 25 GB.
    - You do NOT need to install/configure/run a License manager.
    - Please do NOT share this info with people that have no right to use the
      RU concurrent academic license.
