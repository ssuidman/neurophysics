There is a new version of Matlab (R2021b), it can be downloaded from:

Windows: https://ftp.science.ru.nl/matlab/.jeeN8ju6/Matlab-R2021b-Windows.zip
macOS:   https://ftp.science.ru.nl/matlab/.jeeN8ju6/Matlab-R2021b-macOS.zip
Linux:   https://ftp.science.ru.nl/matlab/.jeeN8ju6/Matlab-R2021b-Linux.zip

Installation:

	- Save the attached Matlablicense.txt in a directory that you remember.
      or create one with the 2 following lines
      SERVER matlab.science.ru.nl 782BCB673EA6 26000
      USE_SERVER

    - Start the MATLAB installer and select in the upper right corner as
	  Advanced Option: "I have a File Installation Key".
		File Installation Key: 39455-27531-01420-28195-32488-35689-49707-13415-25100-24461-64153-31982-18786-57831-31994
    - When prompted to specify the location of the license file, enter
      the path or browse to the Matlablicense.txt that you have created.
    - You do NOT need to install/configure/run a License manager.

N.B.1: Newest macOS will probably quarantine this download.
	   To fix this, run the following command in a Terminal window:

			xattr <full path to .dmg>

		If you see the output has com.apple.quarantine, the OS is purposely
		quarantining the file because of how it is being downloaded to your
		OS. You can remove this by running the following command in a Terminal
		window:

			sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine <path to zip file>

        The -r option allows the quarantine attribute of all files
        inside of the zip to be changed and the -d removes the given
        attribute value.

		And when the installer doesn't show anything, it might help to
		temporarily disable Gatekeeper, by running the following command
		in a Terminal window:

			sudo spctl --master-disable

		then performing the installation and afterwards run the following
		command in a Terminal window to enable Gatekeeper again:

			sudo spctl --master-enable

		See https://osxdaily.com/2015/05/04/disable-gatekeeper-command-line-mac-osx/
N.B.2: Do not publish this URL, otherwise we have to change it. It
       should only be used by people who are allowed to use the C&CZ-managed Matlab license.
N.B.3: 7zip has no problems with these large files, some Windows Zip programs do.
N.B.4: The Operating System and Matlab Version Road Map can be found at:
	   https://nl.mathworks.com/support/sysreq/roadmap.html
N.B.5: The zip-files need to be unzipped before installation.
       If you install all toolboxes, the installation might need ca. 25 GB.
N.B.6: See http://wiki.science.ru.nl/cncz/Matlab for more info.


Users with a Science account also can install Matlab on Windows by
copying everything from the Install network disc to local storage and
install Matlab from there, or for Linux by copying everything from
lilo:/opt/matlab-<version> to a local /opt/matlab-<version> and run Matlab
from there.
