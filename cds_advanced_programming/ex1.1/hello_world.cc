// my first program in C++
#include <iostream> 
using namespace std ; 

int main() {    
    cout << "Hello World!" << endl ;    
    return 0 ; 
    }

// To run code you need to be in the folder where you want to run something. Then save the cc-file 
// and do "g++ hello_world.cc" which compiles the file and creates a file "a.out". If you want
// give the file a name yourself you have to run "g++ hello_world.cc -o hello_world.out" 
// to create the compiled file "hello_world.out". Now if you want to run the compiled file
// for example to print "Hello World!" you need to do "./hello_world.out". This is specific for
// computer. So it can be that you need to recompile the files to let them work on your current comptuer.
